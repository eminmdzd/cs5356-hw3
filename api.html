        The <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element in HTML is used to provide a caption or description for a
        <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element. I learned that it must be placed inside the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag
        and is often used to describe images, illustrations, or other visual content. It improves accessibility and
        clarity
        by giving context to the media it accompanies. I also found out that <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> can be
        positioned either before or after the content inside <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, which gives flexibility in
        styling
        and layout. Adding it to my website helped me create more informative and structured content around images.

        While exploring CSS, I learned about the <code>animation</code> property and <code>@keyframes</code>, which
        allow for
        smooth and dynamic animations on a webpage. The <code>animation</code> property is a shorthand that combines
        multiple
        animation-related properties, such as duration, timing function, and iteration count. Meanwhile,
        <code>@keyframes</code>
        defines the steps of an animation by specifying how an element should change at different points in time. I
        experimented
        with animating a button to change colors and scale up when hovered over. I found that adding
        <code>ease-in-out</code>
        timing and adjusting <code>animation-delay</code> made the effect feel more natural. Using animations helped
        make my
        website feel more interactive and visually engaging.
