        Hello, I’m a backend engineer with a strong interest in AI and machine learning. I enjoy building scalable systems and
        exploring new developments in deep learning. When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me practicing martial arts,
        traveling to gain fresh perspectives, or immersing myself in a good book. Staying active and curious helps me approach
        challenges with a clear and creative mind.

                In 2019, I moved to Florida to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science at UCF—starting with no prior
                coding experience. I immersed myself in rigorous academics, achieving a 3.9 GPA and earning honors such
                as Magna Cum Laude and multiple appearances on the Dean’s List.

                server-sent events, built a robust Java backend, and developed a modern React front-end. This
                transformative experience solidified my expertise across the full stack.
